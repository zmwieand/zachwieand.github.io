                    <p>She’ll never know how taken back I when she told me that she wanted to take a break.Take some time to think about our relationship. I had figured this was her way of telling me that she wanted to break up without breaking up quite yey, but giving her space has worked in the past. I never liked the idea of time apart, but if it was what she needed, I could understand. I told her where my desk was at school, down to the room number and exact seat position, hoping that she would eventually stop by, but she never did. Every time someone would walk in the room or even walk past, my head shot up to the door disappointed that it wasn’t her. We broke up a few weeks later.</p>
                    
                    <p>She’ll never know how I had to tell my entire family, both my mother’s and father’s side, why she didn’t come to celebrate Christmas with us. Every aunt, uncle, cousin, spouses and their significant others had raised the question. They were all so excited to meet her, and why wouldn’t they be? I told them what an amazing girlfriend she was. I told everyone it was because of my upcoming move to Virginia. I technically didn’t lie to them, I just didn’t tell them the whole story. While the distance certainly would be a large factor in the breakup, she told me that she wanted someone more compatible; someone that she could be 100% invested in, never once doubting that they were meant to be together; she didn’t see this in me. This just didn’t seem an appropriate story for a holiday party.</p>

                    <p>She’ll never know how haunting it is to have a photographic memory. Then again, most people really don’t. In an instant you can return to any moment in your life whether it was the best day of your life or one of the most painful. In the next week to follow, I jumped back to the moment she broke up with me, remembering the entire dialogue; as if I was analyzing a piece of text. I transitioned from sad to angry to empty so rapidly that I thought I was making progress toward moving forward, as if it was a 5 stage process. Sadly the cycle just starts over again. Eventually I started to reminisce over all the good times that we had together; spending nights in the Better Business Bureau parking lot until 3am cuddling in your backseat talking about the random things that came to our minds. Sitting together in Dolores Park drinking Corona’s when she came to visit me in San Francisco, watching her get excited at the pug that was running around. And most importantly, I remember the first time that she told me she loved me. After having a little too much to drink, I was throwing up on my friend’s bathroom floor. She too was kneeling on the floor making sure that I was okay. I told her what a mess I was and it was there that she told me she loved me. One of the best moments of my life, and certainly one of the most memorable.</p>

                    <p>She will never know how much I think about all of the things that we never got to do together. I failed to ever bring her flowers. I always wanted to surprise her with a dozen roses on a random day. I really think that something like that would have brightened her day; the same way that she always brightened mine. I was looking forward to her 21st birthday. I couldn’t wait to finally be able to take her to bars and legally get her drinks. I am upset that we never got to take a trip together. Although she came to see me when I was living in San Francisco, I wanted to do something together just the two of us. I was hoping that we could have went to NYC over the summer of 2017. I have never been there before; it seemed like a good first adventure for the two of us to take.</p>

                    <p>She’ll never know how much thought I put into spending the rest of my life with her. I was looking forward to the day that I could come home to her after a long day. We could decompress over some beer or wine and watch episodes of How I Met Your Mother, probably for the tenth time. After all that was our favorite show to watch together. It was actually what we watched the first few times we hungout. I remember first thinking about this right after my boss’s wedding. She was my first wedding date. After seeing my boss and his wife together, I thought about what a beautiful bride she will one day make; sadly just not mine. When we first started talking about breaking up I remember asking her the most cliche breakup question of all time: “Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” And she responded with: “I honestly don’t know.” While there are certainly an inexhaustible number of possibilities for her future, I don’t think she saw me as a part of any of them.</p>

                    <p>She’ll never know how I have driven myself insane looking at social media since she broke up with me. Obviously her Instagram handle is the first one to show up on every picture she likes, as if the universe had better things to do than torment me. To tell you the truth, I myself started getting more active on social media. It was my way of convincing myself that she still cared about me and what I was up to every time she watched my snap story. But worst of all, you see what her best friend posts. I remember one night her best friend posted on her snap story a video of the new guy she was talking to. She said she wanted better, but knowing that it only took her a month to do it makes you wonder if you’re a good guy at all; if you ever meant anything to her to begin with. I lost it. I had to have rewatched that video dozens of times trying to figure out who he was. It felt like there was a weight pressing down on my chest crushing me from the inside. I thought I was going to vomit. I never ended up falling asleep that night. I spent the night shooting hockey pucks in my basement, playing Call of Duty, and watching YouTube videos. Anything to get my mind off of her really. I had to unfollow her friend from SnapChat. It seemed really petty at the time, but I couldn’t possibly give her the satisfaction of driving me crazy.</p>

                    <p>She’ll never know that I can’t sleep most nights because I lay awake wondering why I wasn’t enough for her. I have to wonder if I’ll ever be enough for anyone honestly. This isn’t the first time that someone couldn’t fully invest in me. It hurts even more because I was totally invested in her. I let my mind wander and have to ask if she never really loved me. Was there someone else? I don’t really know why someone would end what they would describe as a healthy relationship to never talk or see that person ever again.</p>

                    <p>She’ll never know how badly I wish she would contact me. To be perfectly honest, every time my phone gets a notification I hope that it is her; another way to drive myself insane. I was hoping that the two of us would try to spend as much time together as possible before I moved. There are days where I have to face the reality that I may never see her again. It’s pretty scary growing up and losing touch with the people you love. As much as I would love to see her, even just a text message from her would make my entire day. “Hey Zach, how have you been? How were the holidays?” Or “Are you ready to start school in a few weeks? What classes are you taking?” I can’t imagine it being that difficult. Many of my friends, coworkers, and family have asked me if we have talked since we broke up, sadly I respond “no”. And I am sure many people are thinking why don’t you message her? Maybe she is thinking the same thing. But she broke up with me, and hasn’t showed any interest in keeping me a part of her life. I would love to know if I still crossed her mind from time to time.</p>

                    <p>She’ll never know what an absolute pleasure it has been to watch her mature and grow from the freshman in college that I met almost 2 and a half years ago. In the time that I have known her, I have seen her more seriously consider her career path and her college education, which I must say she is doing an amazing job at. I am so proud of how far she has come. For the first time I truly felt like I had a positive influence on someone. I hate knowing that I will never get to know the girl at the end of her journey. After all, she was my best friend. I loved sharing every little detail about my life with her,  because well, she was really easy to talk to, and I loved learning all of the little things about her. It has been a hard couple of months with everything that has happened and I am having a tough time without her in my life. I miss her so much. She was always the first person that I went to when I had good news because she was always so happy for me, and the first person that I went to with bad news because she was always there when I needed her. I loved her such an incredible amount and feel completely lost without her.</p>
